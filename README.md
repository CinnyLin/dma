# Middle Eastern Video on Demand

## Case

Your client, Mevod, is a Dubai based video on demand company. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of a regional Telco that distributes internet and traditional, linear cable; this is the parent company’s beach head product to move into the OTT space. There are limited players currently in the market; an American company, Starz, began offering their OTT service, “Starz Play” in the last few months, and another American company, HBO is rumored to be considering an entry as well. Other international streaming services can be accessed through VPNs. None of the current OTT offerings are tailored to the Middle Eastern / Arabic-speaking market. Mevod’s strategy objective is to becomethe dominant regional market player. Leadership believes focusing on local customers –as opposed to treating the region as a secondary market –is key. The strategy team has outlined two components to their tactical plan: acquiring and/or producing native content (currently primarily generatedin Egyptand Turkey) and offering superior customer service to establish their committed presence to the region.

## Statement of Work

**Cinny Lin** (Consultant) has been engaged to support Mevod (Client) in their market expansion strategy over the next 3 months ending 11-Dec-2020. The client has asked you to put together a marketing strategy plan. They want to synthesize who their customers are, what their customers want, and recommendations for expanding marketing share and improving profitability.

You will conduct 2 of the following analyses:

- A/B testing pricing schemes that the strategy and marketing teams have been piloting to evaluate their effectiveness
- [Customer segmentation](https://github.com/CinnyLin/mevod/tree/master/customer_segmentation)
- [Attribution and allocation](https://github.com/CinnyLin/mevod/tree/master/attribution_allocation) to understand how sensitive our marketing budget is to whether we use customers’ survey responses or technical data to determine optimal allocation
- Churn forecasting and revenue retention opportunities

Since management is testing pricing strategies in A/B testing, they also want a churn forecast analysis, so they can understand downstream forecasted revenue impacts to changing unit economics (plan prices). (i.e. If you choose A/B testing as one of your two analyses, you must do the churn forecasting as your second analysis.)
