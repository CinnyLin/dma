# Customer Segmentation for Fast Food Chain

## Team

Cinny Lin, Scofield Zou, Jackie Zhong

## Case

A private equity firm has just invested in a family-owned, local fast food chain, which operates 9 locations in the Chicago area. In preparation for their first board meeting, they have requested a data-driven review of marketing strategy. With the infusion of private equity cash, the new boardâ€™s focus is now on rapid growth. This will be their first deep-dive on current customer consumption patterns as they get to know the business.

## Conclusion

We identified three customer groups and came up with marketing strategies targeting those groups:
|Customer Group|Profile Features|Targeted Marketing Strategies|
|---|---|---|
|professionals|imited time, prefer small snacks|nearby delivery|
|students/tourists|university routine, weekend get-away (suburban area)|<ul><li>collaborate with college to provide meals for events</li><li>"Take one for your classmate" (inspired by "Share a Coke" campaign)</li></ul>|
|residents|family/couples back home from work, group order high demand from diverse products|<ul><li>family membership</li><li>pick-up style</li></ul>|
