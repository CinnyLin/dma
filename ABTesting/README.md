# A/B Testing for <span>Booking.com</span>

## Team

Cinny Lin, Ellie Dai, Jackie Zhong

## Case

<span>Booking.com</span> believes that users value the area around the location of their rental room (hotel, private residence, etc.). Their marketing team is A/B testing the following two pieces of copy on the website:

- "A": shows the number of reviews received
- "B": shows snippets of the reviews received

## Conclusion

We are able to reject the null hypothesis and say that Variant B produces a higher conversion rate in our setting.

However, we also acknowledge some questions to consider during real-life implementation, such as:

- Are there other potential external factors that affected the result?
- Is the short-term result of higher results in Variant B reflective of its result long-term?
- Is the sample from our collected data representative of the whole population?
