# Customer Retention Strategy for Video on Demand Company

## Team

Junhai Ma, Cinny Lin

## Case

Our music streaming service, Napster 2.0, is interested in improving their customer retention metrics. Currently subscribers pay $10 for access to the service on a month to month basis. Currently customers have an average lifetime of 1.75 months. Because our customers only renew their subscription once after initial purchase, marketing has hypothesized that reducing churn could be one of the most impactful methods for increasing customer lifetime value.

Your manager wants to understand the following:

1. Could offering a discount to customers we have identified as potential churners improve our revenue metric? If so, by how much
2. Who should we make the offer to? Everybody on our service or only those with a high likelihood of churn? How high should that threshold be?
3. If our offer is in the form of a discount to next monthâ€™s bill, how much should that discount be?
4. How sensitive are our conclusions to our modeling assumptions?

## Conclusion

- **Revenue impact**: Offering a 30% discount to potential churners can increase our revenue by 7% under the assumption of 30% acceptance rate.
- **Scope of offering**: We intend to only offer discount to those with more than 60% probability of churning, as predicted by our model.
